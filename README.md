# *Task condition (variant â„– 3):*
"The user enters a floating-point number. 
Read the number and output the integer and fractional parts separately.
Provide for the possibility of leading zeros in the fractional part.
Bonus: ensure that input constraints
are handled (for example, if a number is read as a string, then terminate the program when the specified length is exceeded).
Input example: 10.05
Output example: 10 | 05"

The program is written in the Windows operating system, in the Dev-C++ application in the C programming language.
After entering a variable and reading it, we check it for the following conditions:
as long as the character-by-character reading is not equal to the end of the line / file, the value iteration operator is called.
If the constant expression is equal to any digit in the range from 0 to 9, it is displayed on the screen.
Spaces and "minus" characters are ignored.
The "." sign is replaced by "|". Otherwise, the program will inform us about the error.
The code runs in the Dev-C++ application.
